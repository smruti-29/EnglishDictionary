# EnglishDictionary
A dictionary can be used to look up the meaning of a word. You can also use a dictionary to check the spelling of a word. Dictionaries may also give other information about words, such as word type and word origin.


As you all know, what is a dictionary and what it does do. In this project (Dictionary App in JavaScript), at first, on the webpage, there is only a search input and when you enter any existing word and press enter then there is shown a loading text of “Searching the meaning of…..”.


If the searched word exists then there is shown the meaning, example, synonyms, etc. of the searched word with a slide animation else there is shown a message of “Can’t find the meaning of ……”. There is also a pronunciation icon to pronounce your searched word.
